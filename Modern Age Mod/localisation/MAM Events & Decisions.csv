EVTNAME100000;Apartheid;x
EVTDESC100000;"Apartheid is the name for the policies by which the white minority of South Africa, represented by the National Party, segregated indigenous black Africans and other non-white populations from white Afrikaners. Non-white South Africans were stripped of South African citizenship and made citizens of the ten ""bantustans"", meant to be tribal homelands for black Africans. Several of these bantustans, including Ciskei and Transkei, were proclaimed by South Africa to be independent, though they were not recognized internationally.";x
EVTOPTA100000;History will not look kindly upon this;x
EVTNAME100001;The End of Apartheid;x
EVTDESC100001;The electoral victory of a coalition of anti-Apartheid parties has resulted in the reversal of the National Party's discriminatory policies and the acceptance of South Africa's black African majority as a vital part of South Africa's societal fabric. In addition, tribal devolution has been reduced, resulting in the reintegration of the Ciskei and Transkei bantustans into South Africa.;x
EVTOPTA100001;A great step forward for South Africa;x

EVTDESC15140;A committee of $PROVINCECULTURE$ businessmen and traders from $PROVINCENAME$ have approached the government in $CAPITAL$, wishing to lodge a formal complaint with the open discrimination they face in competition for government contracts. Our government currently pursues a favorization policy -- preferring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ contractors wherever possible -- and this is causing discontent in the $PROVINCECULTURE$ provinces. The committee represents equally the interests of the small business owners and capitalist classes of the province, and we could try to sow discontent among them.;x

civilian_gps;Civilian Global Positioning System;x
civilian_gps_desc;Historically, after Korean Air Lines Flight 007, carrying 269 people, was shot down in 1983 after straying into the USSR's prohibited airspace, in the vicinity of Sakhalin and Moneron Islands, President Ronald Reagan issued a directive making GPS freely available for civilian use, once it was sufficiently developed, as a common good. The first satellite was launched in 1989, and the 24th satellite was launched in 1994.;x
selective_availability;Selective Availability;x
selective_availability_desc;GPS included a (currently disabled) feature called Selective Availability (SA) that adds intentional, time varying errors of up to 100 meters (328 ft) to the publicly available navigation signals. This was intended to deny an enemy the use of civilian GPS receivers for precision weapon guidance. SA errors are actually pseudorandom, generated by a cryptographic algorithm from a classified seed key available only to authorized users (the U.S. military, its allies and a few other users, mostly government) with a special military GPS receiver. Mere possession of the receiver is insufficient;x
inertial_navigation_system;Inertial Navigation System;x

red_dot_sight;Red Dot Sights;x
red_dot_sight_desc;A red dot sight is a common classification for a type of non-magnifying reflector (or reflex) sight for firearms that gives the user an aimpoint in the form of an illuminated red dot. A standard design uses a red light-emitting diode (LED) at the focus of collimating optics which generates a dot style illuminated reticle that stays in alignment with the weapon the sight is attached to regardless of eye position (nearly parallax free). They are considered to be fast acquisition and easy to use gun sights for target shooting, hunting, and in police and military applications.;x
second_gen_guidance;Second-Generation Guidance Systems;x
second_gen_guidance_desc;Second-generation semi-automatically command guided SACLOS missiles require the operator to only keep the sights on the target until impact. Automatic guidance commands are sent to the missile through wires or radio, or the missile relies on laser marking or a TV camera view from the nose of the missile. Examples are the Russian 9M133 Kornet and the American Hellfire I missiles. The operator must remain stationary during the missile's flight.;x
third_gen_guidance;Third-Generation Guidance Systems;x

heat_warhead;High-Explosive Anti-Tank Warheads;x
heat_warhead_desc;High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads are made of an explosive shaped charge that uses the Munroe effect to create a very high-velocity partial stream of metal in a state of superplasticity that can punch through solid armor.;x
tandem_charge;Tandem-Charge;x
tandem_charge_desc;A tandem-charge weapon is an explosive device or projectile that has two or more stages of detonation. It is effective against cage armor, which is designed to protect an armored vehicle (mostly tanks) against anti-tank munitions. The first stage of the weapon is typically a weak charge that pierces the reactive armor of the target without detonating it, causing little damage to the armor beneath. However, after the reactive armor has been penetrated the location is left more vulnerable, as there then exists a channel through the reactive armor which the HEAT jet of the second warhead may pass unimpeded. The second detonation from the same projectile (which defines it as a tandem charge) attacks the same location as the first detonation where the reactive armor has been compromised. Since the regular armor plating is often the only defense remaining, the tandem charge (second detonation) has an increased likelihood of penetrating the armor.;x
interceptor_body_armor;Interceptor Body Armor;x
interceptor_body_armor_desc;The Interceptor body armor system consists of an Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and two Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) ballistic plates. The OTV features a carrier shell, and three main ballistic panel inserts (left and right side panels, and a rear back panel), which are made with a finely woven Kevlar KM2 fiber. These two parts of the vest are both bullet and heat resistant. The soft ballistic panels are produced in five different sizes (S-XXL), which are installed into their respective pocket on the OTV carrier shell.;x
special_reconnaissance;Special Reconnaissance;x
special_reconnaissance_desc;Special reconnaissance (SR) is conducted by small units of highly trained military personnel, usually from special forces units or military intelligence organizations, who operate behind enemy lines, avoiding direct combat and detection by the enemy. As a role, SR is distinct from commando operations, although both are often carried out by the same units. The SR role frequently includes: covert direction of air and missile attacks, in areas deep behind enemy lines, placement of remotely monitored sensors and preparations for other special forces.;x
direct_action;Direct Action;x
direct_action_desc;"In the context of military special operations, direct action (DA) consists of: ""Short-duration strikes and other small-scale offensive actions conducted as a special operation in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments and which employ specialized military capabilities to seize, destroy, capture, exploit, recover, or damage designated targets.

plastic_tipped_bullets;Plastic-Tipped Bullets;x
plastic_tipped_bullets_desc;"Plastic-tipped bullets are a type of bullet meant to confer the advantages of both spitzer and hollow-point bullets. They consist of a fairly normal hollow-point bullet with the frontal cavity filled in by hard plastic, which is molded into a streamlined shape mimicking the shape of a spitzer bullet. Upon impact, the plastic drives into the hollow point, or fragments into small pieces and the bullet performs like a regular hollow-point, expanding (""mushrooming"") to a larger diameter or fragmenting. The end result is a bullet with the streamlined characteristics of spitzer bullet and the increased terminal mushrooming of JHPs. These bullets possess the aerodynamics for longer, more accurate flights, and the in-target performance to ensure high lethality.";x
